# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Started React basics course on Scrimba, 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Started the React course in preparation for my classes beginning at the end of January.
So far I like React but can already tell that it will change my way of thinking about layout and separation of concerns. Curious to find out more.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
