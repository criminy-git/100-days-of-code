# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Started React basics course on Scrimba, 1 hour (7 videos)

**Thoughts:** Started the React course in preparation for my classes beginning at the end of January.
So far I like React but can already tell that it will change my way of thinking about layout and separation of concerns. Curious to find out more.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued React basics course, 2 hours (10 videos)

**Thoughts**: Great pace of the course, it all makes a lot of sense. Enjoying writing React which is good. Learned the concept of components, more syntax differences (compared to HTML) when using JSX for components, started simple navbar styling in CSS for React component. Managed to get the final 20 minutes of study in, feeling proud of myself.

**Link to work**: Will be uploaded in next udpate.
