# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Started React basics course on Scrimba, 1 hour (7 videos)

**Thoughts:** Started the React course in preparation for my classes beginning at the end of January.
So far I like React but can already tell that it will change my way of thinking about layout and separation of concerns. Curious to find out more.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued React basics course, 2 hours (10 videos)

**Thoughts**: Great pace of the course, it all makes a lot of sense. Enjoying writing React which is good. Learned the concept of components, more syntax differences (compared to HTML) when using JSX for components, started simple navbar styling in CSS for React component. Managed to get the final 20 minutes of study in, feeling proud of myself.

**Link to work**: Will be uploaded in next udpate.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Repeated CSS styling of React components section, revision of how to style navbar and footer, how to use flexbox to align items horizontally and add the correct spacing between them, played around with styling, good repetition. 

**Thoughts**: Glad I took the time to revise these topics. Still unsure how to wrap the component sections into a flex wrapper as the main component and the header / footer are in different divs. Going to find out until tomorrow.

### Day 4: January 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to organise components into their own files and how to import/export them. Then took a deep dive into installing node via nvm, learning more about the commmand line while I was at it. 

**Thoughts**: Feels like not much progress today while it feels like a lot at the same time. Not comfortable installing programs through the terminal yet for some reason, unfamiliar UI. Hoping it will all come together and make sense shortly. 

**Link to work**: not today, theoretical day reorganising code and installing node and nvm
